<h3 align="center">Full-Stack Developer | Software Developer | DevOps & Infra Enthusiast</h3>

🌐 I'm currently working on full-stack web applications using Laravel and Vue.js, developing and maintaining legacy systems in PHP, and designing APIs for public sector solutions.

🔧 I love contributing to backend systems, custom admin dashboards, and tech support automation tools using PHP, SQL Server, and Docker.

🚀 I'm interested in collaborating on open source projects related to web platforms, digital process automation, or civic tech.

🧠 Constantly learning about system architecture, software design patterns, and infrastructure as code.

📚 Applying agile methodologies like Scrum in government development teams to streamline public service systems.
